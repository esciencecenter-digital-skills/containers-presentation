# Why?
## You want to use software
- Run software that's not available on your OS
- Run software that's hard to install on any OS
- Dealing with many dependencies
- Check results against different versions of same software
- Reproduce a colleague's results

## You want others to run yours
- Deployment: have it work on someone elses computer
- Your users complain about not being able to install
- Have a colleague check your results
